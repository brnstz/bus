  vars_files:
    - "group_vars/defaults.yml"
    - "group_vars/{{ inventory }}.yml"

  tasks:

    # If there is a backup, then empty the db and use the backup
    - name: Get the db backup file
      get_url: url="{{ initial_db_backup }}" dest=/tmp/initial_db_backup.sql.gz force=yes

    # Clear the database and load the backup file
    - name: Load db backup
      shell: echo "DROP SCHEMA PUBLIC CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA PUBLIC;" | psql -U postgres && gunzip --stdout /tmp/initial_db_backup.sql.gz | psql -U postgres
